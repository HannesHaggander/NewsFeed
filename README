# Sleep Cycle Android coding challenge

## Introduction

For this challenge, you will implement a basic news reader app. It should list news from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org) with an image thumbnail (where available), without using NewsAPI's finished Java library. In order to increase the need for good parallelization, the list should be populated from three *separate and parallel* API calls for different subjects. You may use any subjects you want, but a suggestion would be "Apple", "Google" and "Facebook".

Tapping a news listing should open the article in a detail view for further reading (NewsAPI cuts off the full article text, you *do not* need to get around this). The news list should refresh automatically when the user returns to the app after closing it or using other apps.

If the user opens the app without an Internet connection, the last available news should be displayed, including images.

For your convenience, we have supplied a basic app skeleton. You are not required to use this, if you prefer another way of setting up a new app.

As we want to respect your time, you should spend no more than four hours completing the assignment. If you run out of time, please include a document detailing what parts remain, and a brief description of how you would solve those parts given more time.
